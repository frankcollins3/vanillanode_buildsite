# vanillanode_buildsite
puppeteer.evaluate( () => document.querySelector &amp;&amp; window.objProperty/method() flexbox || grid-area template builder 
while loop facilitated recursive input prompting user specification to:
1) add an element and children if there are none. 
2) edit an element with keywords

The node full stack UI can prompt the USER for command. and puppeteer.launch && puppeteer.evaluate() 
create leverageable methods such as document.querySelector("#id") to target elements of another project.

hopefully:
[      ] [       ]
the app is set up to show the site being built on the right hand side 
while the inputs asking to edit or not occur on the left hand side of the screen [    ] like this.
